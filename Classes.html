          <h4> Vinyasa Yoga</h4>
            This class is based on the traditional parameters of Vinyasa Yoga which are: steadiness, comfort, breath and unwavering focus on breath. This dynamically flowing practice synchronizes postures with the breath. This is a swift moving, theme-based class with mantra, mudra, pranayama (breath), surya namaskaras (sun salutations), standing asanas, twists, balances, core strengthening postures, backbends and inversions and a looong rest at the end. You will leave feeling Yoga Good!
            
            Please note: there is little instruction in this class, instead it is focused on the flow and is best for those with some existing yoga practice. This class is Not Recommended for people with injuries.
